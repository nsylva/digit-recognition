# Digit Classification with KNN and Naive Bayes  
This repository contains the project notebook submitted for my Applied Machine Learning course at the University of California, Berkeley. The notebook is an exploration of the classic MNIST handwritten digit dataset. The goal is to classify digits using K-Nearest-Neighbors and Naive Bayes and test out various feature engineering techniques.
